## These are my personal obs applications
### Applications:
- Server:
  - serves index.html and websockets connection

- Chatbot:
  - listens for commands and emotes to send over websockets to be rendered by Falling Emotes Game
- Falling Emotes Game: 
  - gets emotes from websockets connection and renders them with physics, making them fall from the sky
